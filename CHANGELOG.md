# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.2.9.1] - Minor

### Changed
- Refactored the patch notes system to load and render directly from this `CHANGELOG.md` file.
- This simplifies the update process and ensures a single source of truth for all changes.

### Removed
- The `patch_notes.json` file is no longer used by the application and has been deprecated.

## [0.2.9.0] - Major

### Changed
- The minimap has been completely rebuilt to render as a true isometric representation of the main map, instead of a simple 2D grid.
- The minimap now intelligently zooms and pans to stay focused on your viewport, providing better contextual awareness when zoomed in, while remaining static at low zoom.
- The zoom slider has been moved further to the left of the screen and made longer to make it easier to use.
- The coordinate search box has been moved to the bottom center of the screen.
- UI elements now dynamically resize and reposition based on the available space to support various screen sizes and devices.
  - The minimap is now hidden on displays with a width less than 768px.
  - The tool detects if the screen is in landscape or portrait mode and adjusts the layout accordingly.

### Added
- **New Zoom Presets:** Replaced the zoom preset buttons with a more compact dropdown menu and added a wider range of presets: 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%.
- **More Tile-Merging Presets:** Added new tile-merging presets for 20%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70% and 80% zoom levels for more granular performance control.

### Fixed
- **Predictable Zooming:** Corrected the behavior of the `+` / `‚Äì` zoom buttons. They now increment/decrement the zoom by exactly 1% instead of a variable amount, providing more precise control.
