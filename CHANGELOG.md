# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [9.0.0.0] - Major

### Added
- **New Map Features:** The map now includes new terrain types: **Ruins**, **Forbidden Areas**, and other **Unoccupiable** tiles. The build system correctly prevents placing structures on these special zones.
- **Building Placement Preview:** When selecting a building with a territory range (like a Tower or HQ), a semi-transparent preview of its coverage area is now shown at the cursor, allowing for more precise planning.
- **Enhanced Outpost Visuals:** Many outposts now render with unique, high-quality images instead of generic shapes, greatly improving visual identification across the map.
- **Safe Alliance Deletion:** A new two-step "Delete Mode" has been added to the Alliance Management panel to prevent accidental deletion of alliances and their associated buildings.

### Changed
- **Major UI/UX Overhaul:** The build system has been split into two distinct, more intuitive parts:
  - A persistent **Alliance Management** sidebar (üè∞) for creating, editing, and viewing detailed alliance stats.
  - A pop-up **Build Menu** (üõ†Ô∏è) for entering build mode and selecting buildings to place.
- **Advanced Alliance Details:** Alliances in the management panel are now collapsible. When expanded, they reveal detailed statistics, including the number of towers built, and lists of controlled HQs, outposts, and resource nodes.
- **Territory Rendering Optimization:** The drawing of alliance territory has been significantly optimized for better performance and a cleaner, more continuous border.
- **Refined Minimap Behavior:** The minimap now intelligently switches between a static overview when the main map is zoomed out and a dynamic, context-aware view that follows the viewport when zoomed in.

### Fixed
- **Fixed Build Banner Readability:** The text color on the "Building as..." banner now automatically adjusts for high contrast against the selected alliance's color, ensuring it's always readable.
- **Fixed Info Banner Overlap:** The top "Overwatch" info banner now correctly shifts down when the "Build Mode" banner is active, preventing them from overlapping.
- **Fixed User Building Text:** Corrected the display text for user-placed buildings to properly include brackets around the alliance tag (e.g., `[ABC] PlainsHQ`). The text is also no longer bolded, improving clarity.
- **Fixed Chunk Rendering:** Resolved a bug where zoomed-out map chunks could incorrectly show the color of special areas (like Ruins) instead of the underlying base biome color.
- **Fixed Zoom Precision:** Resolved a potential issue where zoom level comparisons could fail due to floating-point inaccuracies, ensuring features like tile-merging trigger at the correct percentage.

## [8.0.1.0] - Patch

### Fixed
- **Fixed Critical Rendering Bug:** Resolved an issue where tiles would fail to render (appearing as black squares) if user-placed buildings or territory were hidden via the "Show at Zoom" setting. The map's base layer now always draws correctly.
- **Fixed Overwatch Tracking:** Corrected a bug where Outposts were not being properly identified and categorized, preventing them from being tracked by the Overwatch info banner.
- **Fixed Text Rendering on User Buildings:** Fixed an issue where the names on user-placed buildings (like HQs and Statues) were not scaling correctly and were always being rendered at the smallest possible font size.
- **Fixed UI Inconsistencies:**
  - Removed a redundant and confusing "Always Show Claimed Area" checkbox, consolidating its logic into the "Show Territory at Zoom" dropdown.
  - Corrected the values in the "Show at Zoom" dropdowns to accurately reflect their corresponding percentages.

## [8.0.0.0] - Major

### Added
- **New Feature: The Overwatch System!**
  - A new "Overwatch" (üëÅÔ∏è) button and panel have been added to the toolbar.
  - This system tracks the landmark closest to the center of the screen and displays its name and coordinates in a new, non-intrusive banner at the top of the screen.
  - The Overwatch panel provides a hierarchical, collapsible checklist, allowing users to granularly enable or disable tracking for specific categories (Fortresses, Sanctuaries, etc.) or individual buildings.
- **Landmark Images:** Key buildings (King's Castle, Fortresses, Sanctuaries) are now rendered with high-quality images instead of simple colored shapes, dramatically improving the map's visual fidelity.
- **Dynamic Image Scaling:** Landmark images now intelligently scale up as the user zooms out. This is controlled by new configurable `imageScaleBreakpoint` values in the building data, ensuring buildings remain recognizable at a distance without overwhelming the view when zoomed in.
- **View & Setting Persistence:** The application now saves your work and preferences automatically.
  - The map's last known camera position and zoom level are saved to the browser, so your view is restored on refresh.
  - All selections made in the Overwatch panel are also saved and reloaded, preserving your tracking preferences between sessions.
- **Granular Render Controls:** The "Build Overlays" settings have been enhanced, splitting the old "Show at Zoom" control into two distinct dropdowns: one for "Show Territory at Zoom" and one for "Show Buildings at Zoom," giving users precise control over map clutter.

### Changed
- **Intelligent Info Banner Coloring:** The Overwatch info banner now automatically detects the brightness of the building's color it's displaying and sets the font color to either black or white for optimal contrast and readability.
- **Refined Overwatch Panel UI:** The "King's Castle" entry in the Overwatch panel is now a single, non-collapsible item for a cleaner and more logical user experience.

### Fixed
- **Fixed Critical Rendering Bug:** Resolved an issue where tiles would fail to render (appearing as black squares) if user-placed buildings were set to "Never" show, ensuring the base map always draws correctly.
- **Fixed Overwatch Tracking Logic:** Corrected a bug where Outposts and Alliance Resource Buildings were not being properly identified, preventing them from being tracked by the info banner.
- **Fixed Overwatch Panel Alignment:** Resolved a CSS layout issue where the "King's Castle" checkbox was misaligned with the other category checkboxes.

## [7.1.0.0] - Minor

### Added
- **Building Limits:** A new rule system has been implemented. All buildings except for Alliance Towers are now limited to one per alliance, preventing the placement of duplicates. The "Buildings" palette now intelligently disables buttons for buildings that have reached their limit.
- **Coverage Preview:** When selecting a building with a coverage area (like a Tower or HQ), a semi-transparent preview of its territory range is now shown at the mouse cursor, allowing for precise placement before clicking.
- **Default Buildings Additions:** Added a few Outposts and unoccupiable tiles to the map.

### Changed
- **Optimized Territory Borders:** The rendering of alliance territory has been significantly improved. Instead of drawing a border around every individual tile, the system now draws a single, clean outline around the entire territory, improving both performance and visual clarity.
- **Enhanced Minimap Responsiveness:** The minimap's panning and zooming logic has been drastically improved. It now immediately and aggressively centers on your viewport as you zoom, ensuring the viewport indicator remains visible and useful at all zoom levels.
- **Redesigned Building Palette:** The floating "Buildings" button now toggles a compact, two-column palette that slides in from the right, improving usability and screen real estate. Button text is now centered for a cleaner look.

### Fixed
- Fixed a critical bug that prevented the map from being dragged while in Build Mode. Panning now works correctly, except when a building is actively selected for placement.
- Corrected a text rendering issue where building names with multiple lines (e.g., "Lv.2 Arsenal") were not centered properly within their footprint.
- Fixed a bug that prevented the 'Landmarks' tab in the Navigation panel from being clickable.
- Fixed an issue where opening other panels (like Settings or the Buildings palette) would incorrectly exit Build Mode.
- Fixed a bug where the building palette would not correctly update its disabled buttons (for limited-quantity buildings) unless it was already open when a building was placed or deleted.
- Corrected display text for user-placed buildings to include a space between the alliance tag and the building name (e.g., "ABS PlainsHQ" instead of "ABSPlainsHQ").

## [7.0.1.0] - Patch

### Changed
- **Redesigned Building Palette:** The floating "Buildings" button now toggles a compact, two-column palette that slides in from the right, improving usability and screen real estate. Button text is now centered for a cleaner look.

### Fixed
- Fixed a critical bug that prevented the map from loading on startup.
- Fixed an issue where the list of alliances would not populate from browser backups when opening the 'Manage Plan' panel.
- Alliance Tags on user-placed buildings will now correctly appear only when zoomed in beyond 30%.
- Fixed a logic error that prevented the creation of alliances with 3-character tags.
- The "Building as..." banner now correctly updates its color immediately after selecting a new alliance.
- Opening and closing the 'Manage Plan / Alliances' panel no longer incorrectly exits Build Mode.

## [7.0.0.0] - Major

### Added
- **Introducing Build Mode!**
*A comprehensive new system for planning alliance territory and building layouts.*
  - **Alliance Creation:** Create and manage multiple alliances, each with a unique name, 3-character tag, and color.
  - **Building Placement:** Place 8 different types of alliance buildings, including Towers, HQs for each biome, and prestige statues.
  - **Claimed Territory:** Towers and HQs automatically project a colored **Claimed Area** on the map. The system uses the same "first-come, first-served" hierarchy as in game, preventing territory from being claimed by more than one alliance.
- **Save & Share Your Plans!**
  - **Import/Export:** You can now save your complete build plans (alliances and buildings) to a `.json` file and import them later to share with others or continue your work.
  - **Automatic Browser Backups:** Your current plan is automatically saved in your browser, preventing data loss if you accidentally close the tab.
  - **Clear Plan:** A new "Clear Plan" button has been added to the Settings panel to easily start a new design from scratch.
- **UI for Building:**
  - A floating "Buildings" palette appears on the right side of the screen when in Build Mode for rapid placement of structures.
  - A "Always Show Claimed Area" toggle has been added to the Settings panel, allowing you to see territory overlays even when not in Build Mode.
  - The üõ†Ô∏è "Build" button opens a dedicated management panel. A separate "Enter/Exit Build Mode" button within this panel provides more intentional control.
  - The top "Build Mode" banner changes color to match the currently selected alliance.

### Fixed
- **Smarter Minimap State:** The minimap now correctly defaults to being visible on desktop screens and hidden on mobile, providing a better out-of-the-box experience for all users.
- **Correct Panel Positioning:** The 'Zoom Presets' panel now opens correctly adjacent to its button on the toolbar, instead of from the center of the screen.
- **Proper Landmark Sorting:** The 'Available Landmarks' list is now correctly sorted with "King's Castle" appearing first, followed by Fortresses and Sanctuaries.
- **Functional Controls Modal:** The 'Controls' button in the Settings panel now opens a proper, informative modal window instead of a basic system alert.
- **Smoother Minimap Interaction:** Removed the pan animation after dragging on the minimap, which prevents a "snap-back" effect and makes navigation feel more direct.
- **Building Render Bug:** Fixed a rendering bug in low-detail (chunked) view where some buildings were not being drawn correctly.

## [6.0.0.0] - Major

### Added

  - A new, ergonomic bottom toolbar provides easy thumb access to all major functions.
  - Buttons for Zoom, Fit to Screen, Search, Bookmarks, and Settings are now consolidated in the toolbar.
- **Mobile Modal Panels:** To maximize map visibility, Search, Bookmarks, and Settings now open in clean, full-screen overlay panels instead of cluttering the main view.

### Changed
