## üöÄ Local Development

To run this project on your local machine:

1.  Clone or download the repository.
2.  Ensure the following files are in the same directory:
    *   `map.html` (the main file)
    *   `baseMap.json`
    *   `patch_notes.json`
3.  Because the application uses the `fetch()` API to load local JSON files, you may need to run it from a simple local web server to avoid browser security (CORS) errors. A simple way to do this is with Python:
    ```bash
    # From your project directory, run:
    python -m http.server
    ```
    Then, open your browser to `http://localhost:8000`.
